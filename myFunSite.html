						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Traveling shapes people, because it provides them with a different perspective of the world. People tend to get caught in their own bubble, and it is very reasonable to do so. For one thing, traveling can be extremely expensive and time consuming. It requires taking time off from work or school, and it disrupts the flow of our weekly schedules. However, I think that travel can be simple; it does not necessarily have to be traveling to a foreign country, or even require getting on a plane for that matter. Travel means going to a place that is outside of your home; it can be going on a road trip for the weekend, or even going somewhere close to home that you have never been before. New places, experiences, and people shape us. They are what cause us to grow, change, and learn. In life, it is truly important to utilize what we have around us. So, maybe the next time you are on the couch on a Saturday, look into what is around you. Even if it is as simple as going to a new nature park, seizing the opportunities around us is what will enrich your day.</p>

								<h3>Ganga River
									Varanasi, India</h3>
								<p>When it comes to natural healing, few places are more renowned than India’s Ganges River. Hindus throughout the country make the journey to Varanasi, on the banks of the Ganges, to spread the ashes of their deceased relatives, believing the river will transport their souls to heaven and help them escape the endless cycle of rebirth.</p>

								<h3> Ubud
									Bali, Indonesia</h3>
								<p>No list of natural healing places around the world would be complete without a mention of Bali. Nicknamed “the Island of Gods,” the Indonesian island is home to spiritual traditions that date back centuries. While you can find temples and healers all over, Ubud is known as the go-to place for a spiritual escape, with its welcoming shamans, art classes, yoga, and healthy food.</p>
